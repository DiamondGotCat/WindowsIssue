# WindowsIssue by Nercone
Unofficial Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 issue tracker repository

## Purpose
Windows issues rarely get reported to the official bug tracker.
This repository was created to highlight real Windows issues.

## Contributing
You can contribute to the issues list by creating a new JSONC file in the issues directory.<br>
Don't forget to run `index.py` after creating the new file.

**Note:** Please do not create vulnerability issues until they have been publicly disclosed by Microsoft or a CVE.

## Future Plans
- [x] Create first issue record
- [ ] Create CLI Tool "WindowsIssueCLI" for Check Known Issues for Environment

I hate Windows, but I need to use Windows for some .exe file.
